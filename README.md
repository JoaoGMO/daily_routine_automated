# daily_routine_automated
This repository is to share how an operacional task that took approximately 30-45 minutes to perform was turned into 4 or 5 keyboard clicks. The description is as the following:
 
Everyday approximately 60 clients make "anniversary" registration and receive a survey so they can provide a feedback on the company's work.
The task is to pass to the commercial team ("Assessors") which clients received this survey throught Whatsapp messages. 

The "dailyAutoTaks" contains the actual code that is recommended to be used (was cleaned up and optimized) and "dailyAutoTaksOriginal" was the original code I wrote for this problem.
